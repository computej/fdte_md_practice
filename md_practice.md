# My favorite video arcade

Sometimes, on the weekends, when I have money to spare, I like to go to a place called [`Next Level Pinball Museum`](https://www.nextlevelpinballmuseum.com/).
It is a large video arcade featuring over **475 games** on free-play with and admmision fee of **20$**, from **video games** to **pinball machines**. A small minority of them **cost money**, mostly prize machines and photo booths.

It is quite far from my home, all the way in **Hillsboro**. I first need to ride the **light rail** near my home all the way to **Hillsboro Airport**. I then need my **bicycle** to make the rest of th 1.1 mile ride to the place.
